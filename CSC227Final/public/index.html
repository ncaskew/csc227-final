                    <h3><a id="about"></a>About</h3>
                    <p>Mac DeMarco is a Canadian singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer.</p>
                    <p>
                        DeMarco has released six full-length studio albums, his debut Rock and Roll Night Club (2012),
                        2 (2012), Salad Days (2014), Another One (2015), This Old Dog (2017),
                        and Here Comes the Cowboy (2019).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His style of music has been described as "blue wave" and "slacker rock",
                        or, by DeMarco himself, "jizz jazz".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From around 2012 DeMarco resided in Queens, New York. In late 2016 he moved with his girlfriend,
                        Kiera McNally, to the Silver Lake neighborhood in Los Angeles,
                        where he has resided since and regularly hosts jam sessions with musicians and friends such as
                        Thundercat, Anderson Paak and the late Mac Miller.
